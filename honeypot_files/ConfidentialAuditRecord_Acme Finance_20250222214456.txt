Re: Financial Statement Review

Dear Team,

I would like to draw your attention to our recently concluded Confidential Audit Record. This quarterly audit concentrated primarily on our financial statements.

While the final review of the report is still underway, our initial findings suggest that Acme Finance demonstrated exceptional financial performance in the last quarter. Our balance sheet and income statements indicate significant financial growth, which is a testament to our collective effort and dedication. 

It's imperative that the specific details of this Confidential Audit Record remain confidential within our department until the completion of our analysis, after which we will present our findings to upper management and other relevant departments. I kindly request each team member to adhere to strict confidentiality protocols regarding this matter.

Once the final review is complete, we will convene a departmental meeting to discuss the findings and elucidate the details of the financial statements.

Thank you for your unwavering dedication, cooperation, and professionalism.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]
[Your Position]
Acme Finance.
