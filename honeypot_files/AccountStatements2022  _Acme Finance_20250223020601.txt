Re: Account Statements 2022

Dear Team,

As we approach the end of the fiscal year, we would like to remind everyone about the upcoming Account Statements for 2022. The statements will be generated and sent out to all clients by the end of January. Please ensure that all relevant transactions are recorded and reconciled before the final cutoff date, which is January 15th.

In preparation for this process, we ask that you review any outstanding items and address any discrepancies by the end of the month. Your cooperation is essential in ensuring a smooth and efficient reporting process.

If you have any questions or require further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact the Accounts Department.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,

Accounts Department
